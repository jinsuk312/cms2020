								<h3>What is Microblading?</h3>
								<p>
									Microblading, also known as Eyebrow Embroidery is a procedure
									categorized under permanent makeup, but unlike traditional
									cosmetic tattooing, it is lesss permanent. Microblading
									typically lasts 1-3 years, depending on skin type and skincare
									routine.
								</p>
								<p>
									The procedure is done by using a hand tool with ultra fine
									blades and each 'hair' is gently etched into the skin, givng
									an incredibly natural and realistic look.
								</p>
								<p>
									Microblading can dramatically correct or fully reconstruct
									lost eye brow and is excellent for those wanting to enhance
									their brows or who have little to no eyebrows, thinning brows
									from age or over tweezed brows. Pigments used are chosen to
									match the natural or desired brow color and skin tone will
									also be taken into consideration.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Is it safe?</h3>
								<p>
									Absolutely. Sterlized, disposable needles and supplies are
									used during the process.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Is Microblading for me?</h3>
								<p>
									I would be happy to consult with you to determine if you are a
									good candidate for microblading.
								</p>
								<p>You may not be a good candidate if you are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Pregnant</li>
									<li>Breastfeeding</li>
									<li>Insulin-dependent Diabetic</li>
									<li>Taking blood thinning medication</li>
									<li>Have autoimmune disorder</li>
									<li>Recently completed chemotheraphy</li>
									<li>Have psoriasis/dermatitis, eczema, keratosis pilaris</li>
									<li>
										Have chronic acne, rosacea on and around the brow area
									</li>
									<li>You have a heart condition</li>
									<li>You have taken Accutane in the last year</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>How long does Microblading take?</h3>
								<p>
									For the first session, the entire procedure should take about
									1.5-2.5 hours. During this session, the brow artist will shape
									and style the clients brows on clients approval.
								</p>
								<p>
									We then follow with pigment color selection. Once the client
									is satisfied with the choices, we begin the procedure.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>How long does it take to heal?</h3>
								<p>
									The eyebrow area will be slightly red after the procedure and
									color will appear very dark. This is normal for the procedure
									and part of the healing process. The color will fade by up to
									40%-60% as it heals.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the following days, the eyebrows will continue to be dark
									and you will notice slight scabbing. Do not pick at the scabs
									as this may damage the skin and the outcome aof the
									microbladed area.
								</p>
								<p>
									The eyebrows will lighten up in color as it heals. No down
									time is required after microblading procedure. It takes
									approximately 7-14 days for the brows to heal over, and about
									1 month for the color to fully set in.
								</p>
								<p>
									You'll notice the color is very light right after the two
									weeks after healing; the skin will have an opaque milky
									looking quality to it. This is known as the milk skin and is
									common in tattooing. This is due to the tissue still healing
									from the inside out even though the surface of the skin is
									healed. True color will reveal itself once healed.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Does Microblading hurt?</h3>
								<p>
									The pain level for the procedure is considered mild to none.
									Prior to the procedure your brow technician will apply a
									topical anesthetic to numb the area, and also reapplied during
									the procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Everyone responds differently to anesthetic; depending on the
									client, the feeling of the procedure has been described as
									light cat scratches to not feeling anything. Topical
									anesthetics used may container lidocaine, prilocaine,
									benzocaine, tetracaine and epinephrine.
								</p>
								<p>
									After the procedure, redness and slight swelling in the area
									is normal. Clients describe the area feeling similar to a
									light sunburn. Clients can take Tylenol but not aspirin or
									ibuprofen.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>How long does Microblading last?</h3>
								<p>
									Since microblading pigments are not implanted into the skin as
									deep as traditional tattoos. The area will naturally fade
									overtime. Microblading typically lasts 1-3 years. Depending on
									skin type(normal, oily, dry), age(youthful/mature). Skincare
									routine will also affect the lasting effects of the pigment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Patients who tan, uses products with AHA or Gylcolic Acid will
									fade faster as your skin will resurface faster. Each
									individual's color retention within the skin will vary. To
									maintain brows looking fresh, a touch up is suggested every
									12-18 months. Clients can let the microbladed area fade over
									time. But please note a slight shadow may remain.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>
									Is there anything I should/shouldn't do before Microblading?
								</h3>
								<p>Avoid working out on the same day of your procedure.</p>
								<p>
									No alcohol or caffeine 24 hours before your procedure (i.e.
									decaf coffee and tea). This will prevent any excess bleeding
									and minimizes swelling during the procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avoid Fish Oil, Niacin, Vitamin E, "Hair, Skin, Nail"
									supplements and/or Ibuprofen, 48 hours before your procedure.
									All these can cause blood thinning and heavy bleeding.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is much better to wait until you are in good health. If you
									know you're going to be taking antibiotics, I recommend
									waiting at least 1 week after taking the dose of medication
									before getting your tattoo, and never attempt to get a tattoo
									while sick if the risk of spreading infection is high.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avoid sun exposure and tanning 1 week before your procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									No facials or chemical peels a week before your procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									No brow waxing, tinting, and electrolysis one week before your
									procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									If possible, exfoliate the brow area a week before your
									procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avoid using any Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) products close to the
									eyebrow area 2 weeks before your procedure. Moisturizers, face
									washes, BB/CC creams and makeup primers may contain acid.
								</p>
								<p>
									No Latisse on the brow area 3 weeks before and after your
									procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avoid Glycolics, Chemical Peels and Retinol - A 4 weeks before
									your procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you use Botox, it should be performed 3 weeks before your
									scheduled procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you've had any cosmetic surgical procedures done on the
									face area, please wait 2-3 months to fully heal prior to the
									eyebrow tattoo procedure.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avoid using any acne products or Accutane for 1 year. NO
									EXCEPTIONS!
								</p>

								<h3>What to expect after the procedure?</h3>
								<h4>The Healing Process</h4>
								<p>
									Immediately after, shape may appear uneven due to swelling.
								</p>
								<p>On day 1-3...</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Eyebrows will appear darker, thicker and uneven.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>On day 4-7...</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Eyebrows will be dry and itchy (DO NOT scratch, rub or pick
										at it).
									</li>
									<li>They might start to crack, scab or flake off.</li>
									<li>
										Eyebrows will look patchy and uneven during healing process.
										It is absolutely normal. Please DONâ€™T panic.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>On day 7-14...</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Scabs should be completely fallen off.</li>
									<li>
										The healed results may appear 10-30% lighter in color and
										about 15% smaller in size.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Sometimes eyebrows will appear as if there is no color. The
									remaining color has been absorbed under the layer of skin and
									in the following week it will resurface as skin cells repair.
									In 3-4 weeks, eyebrows will appear in true color. Eyebrow
									might still look patchy or uneven shape and in rare cases,
									pigment won't retain well. In 6-8 weeks, please come back for
									a touch up. Any small corrections can be made at this visit.
								</p>
								<p>
									Different effect on different individuals (e.g. different skin
									types affect the attachment of color). Most clients will need
									two sessions, some will only need one and some will need a
									third touch-up to complete the look at an extra charge.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>Do I need a consultation?</h3>
								<p>
									In most case your appointment will be part of your
									consultation. However if you have/had previous microblading,
									permanent makeup, skin issues, scar tissues or medical issues,
									a seperate consultation may be needed. Please contact me with
									any questions along with any of the previous mentioned points.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>
									What is the difference between microblading and shading?
								</h3>
								<p>
									Shading is a different technique of depositing pigment into
									the skin. It give an illusion of a fuller and more powdered
									brow.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>How do I know if I need shading or not?</h3>
								<p>We can decide on it together the day of the appointment.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3>What is Nano Brows?</h3>
								<p>
									Nano brows are still 'hair like strokes' but they are done
									with a hand held machine with a single flexible 'nano' needle,
									it's ideal for everybody but even more so for oilier skin
									types because it creates less trauma to the epidermis due to
									the thinness of the needle itself.
								</p>
								<p>
									Nano brows will give you a more structured bolder look while
									maintaining 'hair like' strokes.
